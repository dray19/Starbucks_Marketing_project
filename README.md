# Starbucks_Marketing_project
Code from gathering data and predicting optimal Starbucks locations.

“Geocoding_census.ipynb “ is code used to gather data from the Census API and find which census tract each store and rail station are in. 

“star_to_census.R” is code for merging and cleaning the transportation and  census tract data. 

“master_dataset.R” is code for cleaning and adding the median value for records that were null. This was the last cleaning before creating the final dataset. 

“testing_dataset.csv” is the final csv from merging and cleaning data from census tract, Starbucks locations, and rail station data. 

“Starbucks_code.ipynb” is code that was used to predict the optimal new census tracts for Starbucks in  New York city, Chicago, and Philadelphia . EDA was performed first to gather more information on the data set. Some was done in this file and some was done using Tableau, which there is a link to in the PowerPoint. 

Also attached is the paper and PowerPoint used to present the findings. The images of the census tract inside the PowerPoint with a Starbucks inside them or not was done using spatial data in Tableau.
